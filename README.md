## How to Use the API  

### 1. Authentication  

#### Create an Account  
Sign up to get started.  

```bash  
POST /signup  
Content-Type: application/json  

{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "password_confirmation": "SecurePass123!"
  }
}
```  

#### Log In and Get Your JWT Token  
```bash  
POST /login  
Content-Type: application/json  

{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!"
  }
}
```  

The token will be in the response headers under `Authorization`. Youâ€™ll need this token for all API requests.

### 2. Profile Generation  

#### Generate a Single Profile  
```bash  
GET /api/v1/person  
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here  
```  

**Example Response:**  
```json  
{
  "data": [{
    "name": "Richard Stamm",
    "email": "edison.stiedemann@kutch.example",
    "address": {
      "street": "993 Earlene Radial",
      "city": "Pourosville",
      "state": "Mississippi",
      "country": "Guyana",
      "zip_code": "59029-1260"
    },
    "phone": "132-694-1497",
    "job": "Legacy Farming Technician",
    "company": {
      "name": "Kulas LLC",
      "industry": "Shipbuilding"
    },
    "social_media": {
      "twitter": "man_borerman_borer",
      "linkedin": "keneth.marvin"
    },
    "date_of_birth": "1966-06-10",
    "credit_card": {
      "number": "58194442128665567",
      "expiry_date": "2027-12-31"
    }
  }]
}
```  

#### Generate Multiple Profiles  
```bash  
GET /api/v1/people?count=10  
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here  
```  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Keep your token secure and always include it in the `Authorization` header for API requests.
